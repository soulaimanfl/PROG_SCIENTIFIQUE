# Polynomial Model Fitting
This repository contains a Java implementation for fitting a polynomial model to a set of data points using the least squares method. The implementation also includes visualization capabilities using JFreeChart to display the original data points and the fitted polynomial curve.

## Features
Polynomial model fitting using the least squares method.
Visualization of the original data points and the fitted polynomial.
Calculation and display of the polynomial coefficients.
## Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
JFreeChart library for data visualization.
